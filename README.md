# Running My Angular Application 

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

### 1. Install Node
Node.js is required to run the Angular application. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### 2. Install npm
npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js. To verify that npm is properly installed, you can check the installed version by running the following command in your terminal:
```sh
npm -v

### 3. Install the Angular CLI
The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is used to manage and develop Angular applications. Install it globally on your system using the following npm command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Setup and Run the Application

### Clone the Repository
Clone the repository containing the Angular application code to your local machine:

`git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>`

### Install Dependencies
Navigate to the root directory of the Angular application and install the required dependencies using npm:

`npm install`

## Run the Application
After the installation is complete, use the Angular CLI to run the application locally:

`ng serve`

This command will compile and serve the application. Access it in a web browser by navigating to http://localhost:4200/.






















This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
